# Build and Run

If you want to understand how mitype works or want to debug an issue, you'll want to get the source, build it, and run it locally.

## Getting the Source

First, fork the mitype repository so that you can make a pull request. Clone your fork locally and then you can navigate to the directory where you've cloned the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/<<<your-github-account>>>/mitype.git
cd where-you-cloned-mitype
```

## Running in Development Mode

Once you have a local copy of mitype cloned, you can directly run mitype in Development Mode.
```
python -m mitype [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

## Installing from Source

You can install the module directly from sources by running the following command.
```
python setup.py install
```
